Several full species of the genus <i>Geomys</i> have been recorded from
Kansas. The purpose of the study now reported upon was to determine
the present taxonomic status of these animals and the distribution
of each within the boundaries of Kansas. No pocket
gopher of any kind has been reported from the southeastern part of
the state; in all other parts <i>Geomys</i> is locally common.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>The first published reference that we have found to pocket gophers
of Kansas is Prof. Spencer F. Baird's (1857:377, 380) mention
of two specimens from Fort Riley. One he identified as <i>Geomys
bursarius</i> (p. 377) and the other (p. 380) he doubtfully referred to
<i>Geomys breviceps</i>. Both specimens were obtained by Dr. W. A.
Hammond. J. A. Allen (1874:49) reported pocket gophers from
Kansas under the generic name "Geomys?". Professor M. V. B.
Knox (1875:21) published a list of Kansas mammals in which he
used the names <i>Geomys bursarius</i> Shaw and <i>Geomys breviceps</i>
Baird, the last one for the specimen taken by Dr. Hammond, at
Fort Riley. Baker (1889:57) employed the name <i>Geomys bursarius</i>
Rich. for the gopher "found along the hundredth meridian, between
N latitude 38&deg; 30' and 39&deg; 30'." He reported this animal as common
in western Kansas. Merriam (1895:129) recorded <i>G. bursarius</i>
and <i>G. lutescens</i> from Kansas. Allen (1895:265) recorded five
specimens of <i>Geomys lutescens</i> collected between September 16 and
October 13 at Long Island, Phillips County, Kansas, by W. W.
Granger. Since that time several papers, some of them dealing
mostly with habits of pocket gophers, have been published in which
reference is made to <i>Geomys</i> in Kansas. Hibbard (1933:240) recognized
three species: <i>G. bursarius</i>, <i>G. lutescens</i>, and <i>G. breviceps
llanensis</i>. In 1944 (74-75) he recorded <i>Cratogeomys</i> from Meade
County, on the basis of two skulls dug out of the ground, and he
recognized the same three full species of the genus <i>Geomys</i> that he
did in 1933, along with two additional subspecies.</p>

<p>Specimens to the total number of 335 from Kansas have been
available for the present study of the five subspecies recognized.
The reason for arranging all of the named kinds as subspecies of a
single species is that intergradation has been found to occur between
<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
every pair of kinds having contiguous geographic ranges. The
characters previously thought by some writers constantly to differentiate,
say, <i>Geomys lutescens</i> of western Kansas from <i>Geomys bursarius</i>
of eastern Kansas, prove not to do so; instead, in areas geographically
intermediate between the geographic ranges of the two
kinds, the pocket gophers are intermediate in morphological characters
and therefore are regarded as intergrades. Intergradation of
this kind here is accepted as the criterion of subspecies, and lack
of such intergradation as the criterion of species. Search for structural
characters, distinctive of the different kinds, additional to
those characters noted by other writers, has resulted in the finding
of a few such characters but they too are subject to intergradation.
Therefore the several kinds are arranged as subspecies of a single
species which takes the name <i>Geomys bursarius</i> because it is the
oldest available name. Detailed comment on specimens showing
intergradation are to be found in the accounts of <i>G. b. bursarius</i>
and <i>G. b. major</i>.</p>

<h2>METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>

<p>The series with the largest number of individuals from one restricted
locality was selected for initial study. These individuals
were segregated by sex, and specimens of each sex were arranged
from oldest to youngest. Each series was divided into age-groups,
and within a given age-group of one sex from one locality of what
was considered as one species, estimation was made of the amount
of individual variation. Thus, it was possible when comparing different
kinds of pocket gophers to use only one age class of one season
of one sex.</p>

<p>Age was estimated to some extent by size of animal and nature
of its pelage. The immature pelage is grayer and the hair is more
crinkled than in adults. A more certain guide to age, however, is
furnished by the skull. With increasing age some sutures disappear,
the rostrum increases in length and the ridges marking the limits
of the temporal muscles come to fuse and eventually, in males,
form a high sagittal crest.</p>

<div

<p>Cranial measurements were taken as follows:</p>

<p>Basilar length.&mdash;From the anteriormost inferior border of the foramen magnum
to a line connecting the posteriormost margins of the alveoli of the first
upper incisors.</p>

<p>Length of the nasals.&mdash;The greatest length of the nasals.</p>

<p>Zygomatic breadth.&mdash;The greatest distance across the zygomatic arches.</p>

<p>Mastoid breadth.&mdash;The greatest distance across the mastoids.</p>
<p> <span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
Breadth of rostrum.&mdash;Width, perpendicular to long axis of the skull.</p>

<p>Interorbital constriction.&mdash;The least distance between the orbits.</p>

<p>Maxillary tooth row.&mdash;The greatest length of the upper molariform tooth
row at the alveolar border.</p>

<p>Extension of premaxillae posterior to nasals.&mdash;From the posteriormost border
of the nasals to the posterior end of the extension of a premaxilla.</p>

<p>Depth of skull.&mdash;From the median suture of the frontals, on the dorsal
surface of the skull to the median suture of the palatines at the level of the
first molar (not premolar).</p>

<p>Length of rostrum.&mdash;From the anterior border of the nasal to the maxilla
at the lateral end of the hamulus of the lacrimal.</p>

<p>In the list of specimens examined, localities are arranged by counties from
west to east, beginning at the northwestern corner of the state; specimens in
each county are arranged from north to south. If several localities are in the
same latitude, the westernmost is listed first. Capitalized color terms are after
Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
1912.</p>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>&mdash;Sandhills on Birdwood Creek, Lincoln County, western Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Distribution in Kansas.</i>&mdash;Northwestern Kansas, eastward certainly to Ellis
County, southward certainly to Scott County.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Animals with total length averaging no more than 272 mm.;
length of vertebrae of tail averaging no more than 92; hind foot averaging no
more than 35. Color: In autumn pelage, upper parts Light Ochraceous-Buff
becoming Buckthorn Brown in middorsal region and there forming a faint
longitudinal band; sides Pale Yellow Orange. In summer, Buckthorn Brown
on upper parts with a dorsal band, especially distinct on specimens from Ellis
and Trego counties; specimens from farther west lack the distinct dorsal band.
Underparts Gray Drab and sometimes whitish, usually whitish in young specimens;
basal color of pelage Deep Neutral Gray; fore and hind feet whitish.
Skull: Zygomatic arch broadly and squarely spreading anteriorly; temporal
impressions uniting to form a low sagittal crest in adult males, but in adult
females and in young males the impressions usually remain apart; shape of
interparietal varying from subquadrate in young specimens to subtriangular
or triangular in adults; in some young specimens the interparietal is reduced
to a minute, ovoid bone.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;See comparisons in the accounts of other subspecies
occurring in Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In his monographic revision of the pocket gophers,
Merriam (1895:129) recorded 3 "typical or nearly typical" specimens
from Trego County, and 18 "non typical" specimens as follows:
Garden Plain, Sedgwick County, 4; Belle Plain, Sumner<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
County, 5; Cairo, Pratt County, 6; Kiowa, Barber County, 2; and
Ellis, Ellis County, 1. A detailed discussion of Merriam's account
of the distribution of <i>Geomys lutescens</i> in Kansas is given by Swenk
(1940:11-12).</p>

<p>Judging by specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of
Natural History, <i>G. bursarius lutescens</i> in Kansas is restricted to
the northwestern part of the state, reaching southward certainly to
Scott County and eastward certainly to Ellis County; precise limits
of distribution of this subspecies are unknown. Additional collecting
is necessary to determine where the range of <i>lutescens</i> meets the
ranges of the other subspecies. The specimens studied are remarkably
uniform. One specimen obtained in October, in Trego County,
is slightly lighter colored than any other from Kansas. In other
characteristics it agrees with specimens from northwestern Kansas
and from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>&mdash;Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Distribution in Kansas.</i>&mdash;Northeastern Kansas, westward certainly to Clay
and Marion counties and southward certainly to Greenwood County.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Color: Upper parts Mummy Brown in fresh appearing pelage
of February but in more worn pelage of March more reddish being near (16')
Prout's Brown; top of head and sometimes back darker than rest of upper
parts; underparts usually with some whitish anteriorly; fore and hind feet
and approximately distal half of tail white. Size: Large, total length averaging
more than 280 mm. in males and 257 in females; hind foot averaging
35 mm. or more in males. Skull: Large; rostrum averaging more than twice
as long as wide; sagittal crest high in males and barely present in females;
occiput vertical when skull is laid top down; least width of braincase less than<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
distance from alveolus of upper incisor to middle of lateral border of P<sup>4</sup> at
alveolar border.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Geomys bursarius lutescens</i>, <i>majusculus</i>
differs as follows: Color darker, Mummy Brown to Prout's Brown
instead of Buckthorn Brown. In both sexes: head and body a fifth
to a sixth longer; hind foot 5 to 6 per cent longer; skull averaging
larger in all parts measured except that premaxillae (in each subspecies)
extend equally far posteriorly to nasals; diastema longer in
relation to basilar length; rostrum longer relative to its width; sagittal
crest higher; rostrum often more depressed distally; angle of
suture between maxilla and jugal more obtuse.</p>

<p>From <i>G. b. bursarius</i>, according to Swenk (1939:6), <i>majusculus</i>
differs in larger size.</p>

<p>From <i>G. b. illinoensis</i>, <i>majusculus</i>, according to Komarek and
Spencer (1931:405), differs in brownish instead of slate-gray coloration
and in two cranial characters as follows: Nasals straight-sided
instead of shaped like an hour-glass, and superficial canals on palatine
extending anteriorly beyond first molar, and from there anteriorly
more or less separated. The first of these characters does not
always hold; occasional individuals of <i>majusculus</i>, for example
some from Douglas County, have the nasals shaped like an hour-glass.</p>

<p>From <i>G. breviceps dutcheri</i>, <i>majusculus</i> differs in larger size
(hind foot more than 33 mm. in males, and 29 in females; basilar
length more than 42 mm. in males and 36 in females); dorsal exposure
of jugal longer than width of rostrum measured between
ventral margins of infraorbital foramina.</p>

<p>From <i>G. bursarius major</i> of southcentral Kansas (for example
Harvey County), <i>majusculus</i> differs in slightly darker color, being
Mummy Brown instead of Prout's Brown; size larger (in males
total length more than 284 mm., hind foot 35 or more, basilar length
of skull more than 42, and in females total length 265 or more, hind
foot averaging 33 or more, and basilar length 40 or more).</p>

<p>Skull: Averaging larger in all parts measured, except that premaxillae
do not extend so far posteriorly to nasals in either males
or females; interorbital constriction slightly narrower in adult females;
temporal ridges forming a more prominent sagittal crest in
adult males (sagittal crest barely present in some adult males of
<i>major</i> from Harper County).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In employing the subspecific name <i>majusculus</i> we are
following Swenk (1939:6) who on the basis of larger size differentiated<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
the animals from southeastern South Dakota, the eastern
parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and the western and southern parts
of Iowa, from <i>G. bursarius bursarius</i> to which he assigned a more
northern geographic range. In the absence of comparative materials
of the northern subspecies we cannot make an independent decision
on the validity of <i>majusculus</i> and recognize that if it is inseparable
from <i>G. b. bursarius</i> the latter name will apply to
specimens from northeastern Kansas. We are the more uncertain
about applying the name <i>majusculus</i> to specimens from eastern
Kansas because they average smaller than topotypes. Only at the
northeasternmost locality in Kansas (3 mi. N Cummings, Atchison
County) do specimens average as large as topotypes of <i>majusculus</i>.
Farther southward they become progressively smaller in eastern
Kansas, and we interpret this as intergradation with the still smaller
subspecies <i>major</i>, to the southwest. The average external measurements
of two adult males from Atchison County are: 321-99-35.
Thirty-six miles farther south, in Douglas County, 16 adult males
average 289-80-36. From Hamilton, Greenwood County, 80 miles
farther southwest, nine adult males average 284-83-35. The maximum
total length recorded at these three localities is: Atchison
County, 342 (1 of 2 specimens), Douglas County, 308 (1 of 16
specimens), Greenwood County, 357 (in coll. of Dr. Glenn C. Rinker
and 1 of 15 males of all ages involved). It will be seen, therefore,
that although there is a trend to smaller average size toward the

<p>Four specimens from Salina (Debold Farm) are intermediate
structurally, as they are also geographically, between <i>G. b. majusculus</i>
on the one hand and <i>Geomys bursarius lutescens</i> and <i>Geomys
bursarius major</i> on the other hand. In color they agree with <i>majusculus</i>,
as they do also in width of nasals posteriorly, in more obtuse
angle of the rostrum and maxillary arm of the zygomatic arch. They
agree with <i>G. b. lutescens</i> in having the occiput inclined anterodorsally,
and are intermediate between <i>majusculus</i> and <i>lutescens</i>, but
nearer the latter in size of skull and in length of the rostrum relative
to its width.</p>

</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Color: Upper parts Cinnamon Brown, slightly reddish, but
in some specimens collected in September, in Pawnee County, near (15&acute; <i>i</i>)
Ochraceous-Tawny; underparts usually Wood Brown, somewhat whitish anteriorly;
forefeet white; hind feet and approximately distal half of tail whitish.
Size: Medium (see measurements), total length averaging not more
than 271 mm. in males and 254 in females; hind foot averaging not more
than 35 mm. in males and less than 32 in females. Skull: In males, least
width of braincase equal to distance from alveolus of incisor to anterior border
of alveolus of first upper molar, occiput strongly inclined anterodorsally, temporal
impressions usually united in a low sagittal crest, zygomatic arch heavy
and curved at level of jugal bone. In adult females least width of braincase
approximately equal to distance from alveolus of incisor to anterior border
of alveolus of first upper molar (not premolar); occiput less inclined anterodorsally<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
than in males; temporal ridges not forming a sagittal crest. In young
females the width of the braincase is more than the distance between the
alveoli of the incisor and first molar.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;<i>G. lutescens industrius</i> differs from <i>G. lutescens
lutescens</i> in: Color darker; least width of braincase not equal to
(usually more than) the distance from the alveolus of incisor to
the anterior border of the alveolus of the first upper molar.</p>

<p><i>G. lutescens industrius</i> differs from <i>G. lutescens jugossicularis</i> in:
Color slightly darker, the former being Cinnamon Brown instead of
Vinaceous Cinnamon, with hairs basally Deep Neutral Gray in upper
parts and underparts. Skull: Jugular part of zygomatic arch
more curved (convex dorsally) and occiput far more inclined anterodorsally;
lower part of mastoidal ridge more prominent.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>G. l. major</i>, see account of that subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Judging from the known specimens of this subspecies,
it has the smallest geographic range of any of the subspecies in
Kansas, but additional collecting in Hodgeman County and counties
to the north and west of it may extend the known range in those
directions; collecting in Comanche County and in adjoining parts
of Oklahoma may extend the known range to the southward.</p>

<p>The anterodorsal inclination of the occiput in males is the one
cranial character in which <i>industrius</i> differs from all of the subspecies
with adjoining geographic ranges. The existence of this
unique (among adjoining subspecies) cranial character is the principal
reason for according subspecific status to this animal. Although
it has other characters which are fairly uniform over a
considerable geographic area, these other characters, namely, Cinnamon
Brown color of the upper parts and medium size of the body,
after all, are conditions intermediate between those in <i>jugossicularis</i>
to the west and those in the darker and larger animals assigned
to <i>major</i> to the eastward. Considering the intermediate geographic
position of <i>industrius</i>, the color and size are approximately what a
person would predict by study of only the animals to the west and
those to the east. Therefore, the color and size probably are indicative
of intergradation between <i>jugossicularis</i> and <i>major</i>. Still,
there is the anterodorsally inclined occiput in males&mdash;a character
of a unique sort&mdash;and this influences us to give subspecific status to
this animal with full recognition of the fact that it is a "weak" subspecies
as compared with any one of the adjoining subspecies.</p>

<p>Hooper (1940:2) in naming as new <i>Geomys lutescens jugossicularis</i>
referred to his new subspecies a skin-only from Meade County<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
State Park. Our more abundant material from there shows the
cranial conformation to be that of <i>industrius</i> to which we accordingly
assign the specimens. However, with only a skin available,
we, too, would have used the name <i>jugossicularis</i> because the color
is paler than in other specimens of <i>industrius</i> and this paleness indicates
intergradation between the two named subspecies. Specimens
from Pratt County are slightly darker than <i>industrius</i> thereby
indicating intergradation between <i>industrius</i> and <i>major</i>.</p>

Bienn. Rept. Kansas State Board Agric., 35:182, 1937; Swenk, Missouri
Valley Fauna, 2:12, February 1, 1940.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Type locality.</i>&mdash;Eight miles west of Clarendon, Donley County, Texas.</p>

<p><i>Distribution in Kansas.</i>&mdash;Southcentral Kansas, northward certainly to Ellsworth
County, westward certainly to Stafford and Barber counties and eastward
to Cowley County.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Color: Upper parts varying from Brussels Brown in some
specimens to nearly Prout's Brown, especially in specimens from central part
of state. Top of head, and sometimes back, darker than rest of upper parts,
but no well defined black stripe; underparts varying from whitish to nearly
Buffy Brown; fore and hind feet and approximately distal half of tail white.
Size: Large (see measurements). Skull: Sagittal crest absent in females and
barely present in males; least width of braincase more than distance from alveolus
of incisor to middle of lateral border of P<sup>4</sup> at alveolar border. Length
of auditory bulla (from anteroventral edge of paroccipital process of exoccipital
to hamulus of peterygoid), in each sex, more than 8 mm.; occiput usually
vertical when skull is laid top down; zygomatic arch broadly and squarely
spreading, divergent anteriorly; rostrum averaging less than twice as long as
wide.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>G. bursarius lutescens</i>, <i>major</i> differs in color
darker, premaxillae extending slightly farther posteriorly; temporal
impressions usually forming a more well-marked sagittal crest in
males; ventral side of zygomatic arch, at level of jugal bone, more
curved.</p>

<p>From <i>G. bursarius majusculus</i>, <i>major</i> differs in slightly lighter<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
color, smaller size of body; in males, total length less than 284 mm.;
hind foot 34 or less; basilar length of skull less than 42; in females
total length less than 264, hind foot no more than 33, and basilar
length less than 39.</p>

<p>From <i>G. bursarius industrius</i>, <i>major</i> differs in color, being Prout's
Brown, instead of Cinnamon Brown (less Fuscous); body averaging
10 per cent longer; total length in males from 9 to 9.7 per cent
longer, hind foot 9.7 per cent longer on the average; skull averaging
larger in all parts measured. Occiput less inclined anterodorsally;
top nearly flat, less arched than that of <i>G. b. industrius</i>; auditory
bulla averaging slightly larger and less inflated.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Specimens of this subspecies from Norman, Cleveland
County, Oklahoma, and Canton, Dewey County, Oklahoma, and
most of those from Kansas, are more Fuscous than topotypes and
tend toward <i>G. bursarius majusculus</i>. Specimens from McPherson
County have a darker dorsal stripe resembling that of <i>G. bursarius
majusculus</i>. One adult from Little Salt Marsh, Stafford County, is
pale, closely resembling topotypes.</p>

<p>Most of the cranial characters, nevertheless, are constant in all
available specimens, except that in specimens of each sex from the
type locality the basilar length averages 4 to 5 per cent shorter. In
the constancy of size of the relatively large auditory bullae and in
the nearly flat dorsal profile of the cranial part of the skull, the
specimens from Kansas agree with the specimens from the type
locality.</p>

<p>Specimens from Harper County have the occiput slightly inclined
anterodorsally and thus are reminiscent of <i>industrius</i> which has an
even greater inclination of the occiput. Probably the appearance
in dilute fashion of this character in Harper County is properly to
be interpreted as intergradation with <i>industrius</i>. If so, the actual
intergradation may be to the northwest <i>via</i> Pratt County since
specimens from Barber County, immediately west of Harper and
lying between Harper County and the range of <i>industrius</i>, do not
have the occiput so inclined.</p>

<p>Of a pair of adults from eight miles west of Rosalia, Butler
County, the female is indistinguishable in color from adults of <i>G. b.
industrius</i> from northern Meade County and from two specimens
from eleven miles west of Clarendon, Donley County, Texas, near
the type locality of <i>G. b. major</i>. The male from eight miles west of
Rosalia is darker as compared either with <i>G. b. industrius</i> or <i>G. b.
major</i> and the coloration of the upper parts resembles those in <i>G. b.</i><span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
<i>majusculus</i>; the underparts are only slightly paler than the upper
parts as in <i>majusculus</i>. Measurements of the skulls are intermediate
between the averages for <i>G. b. majusculus</i> and those for <i>G. b.
major</i>. These specimens from eight miles west of Rosalia are intermediate
structurally, and since they are intermediate geographically
between <i>G. b. majusculus</i> and <i>G. b. major</i>, they suggest intergradation
of the two subspecies. The specimens in question are referred
to <i>major</i> because the size is nearer that of <i>major</i>. It is
mainly the intermediate nature of these two specimens from Butler
County, and the intermediate nature of the specimens from McPherson
County, Kansas, that have caused us to treat <i>G. b. majusculus</i>
as only subspecifically distinct from the more western subspecies,
<i>major</i>.</p>

<h2>SUBSPECIES OF THE SPECIES GEOMYS BURSARIUS</h2>

<p>If <i>Geomys lutescens major</i> Davis is correctly judged to intergrade
with <i>Geomys bursarius majusculus</i> Swenk, the name for the full
species will be <i>Geomys bursarius</i> because <i>bursarius</i> is the oldest
name among those available. Some new combinations of names
are required. According to our present understanding, the eleven
kinds of pocket gophers named below are properly to be arranged
as subspecies of the species <i>Geomys bursarius</i>:</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius bursarius</i> (Shaw). Type from unknown locality in Upper
Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius majusculus</i> Swenk. Type from Lincoln, Lancaster
County, Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius hylaeus</i> Blossom. Type from 10 mi. S Chadron, Dawes
County, Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius levisagittalis</i> Swenk. Type from Spencer, Boyd County,
Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius vinaceus</i> Swenk. Type from Scottsbluff, Scotts Bluff
County, Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius lutescens</i> Merriam. Type from Sandhills on Birdwood
Creek, Lincoln County, Nebraska.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius illinoensis</i> Komarek and Spencer. Type from 1 mi. S
Momence, Kankakee County, Illinois.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius jugossicularis</i> Hooper. Type from Lamar, Prowers
County, Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius industrius</i> new subspecies. Type from 1-1/2 mi. N Fowler,
Meade County, Kansas.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius major</i> Davis. Type from 8 mi. W Clarendon, Donley
County, Texas.</p>

<p><i>Geomys bursarius llanensis</i> Bailey. Type from Llano, Llano County, Texas.<span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
